                <p>“Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had h changed at al.
                    The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room,
                    which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
                    Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.”</p>
